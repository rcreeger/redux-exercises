/*
  Problem #2

  Export a reducer that will manages an array of groceries. It must expect the following action types:
    - ADD_CONTACT
    - FETCH_CONTACTS
    - REMOVE_CONTACT
*/

// Theoretically, these action type labels would be imported from an actions file, but we will define them here in this case.
let ADD_CONTACT = "ADD_CONTACT";
let FETCH_CONTACTS = "FETCH_CONTACTS";
let REMOVE_CONTACT = "REMOVE_CONTACT";

// Write your code below this line!

let initialState = 0;

export default (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD_CONTACT:
      let newContact = {
        id: 4,
        fname: action.payload,
        quantity: 4
      };
      return [...state, newContact];
    case FETCH_CONTACTS:
      return action.payload;
    case REMOVE_CONTACT:
      let theId = action.payload;
      return state.filter(fname => fname.id !== Number(theId));

    default:
      return state;
  }
};
